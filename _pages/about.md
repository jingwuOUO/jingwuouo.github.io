Hi, I'm Jing Wu, a computer vision engineer in Nvidia. I got my bachelor degree in Physics from Fudan University (FDU), Shanghai. Then I spent two years in the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shatin, Hongkong and Shanghai Jiaotong university (SJTU), Shanghai as a research assitant founding my interest in computer vision. After that I went to Georgia Institute of Technology (Gatech), Atlanta and got my master of science degree in computer science. I also completed a master's Thesis under the supervision of Professor Frank Dellaert.

My interests mainly focus on Simultaneous Localization and Lapping (SLAM), Structure from Motion (SFM), Computer Vision (CV), and Perception in Robotics. My major language in programming is C++ and Python.
